## Project: The Dynamic Energy Optimizer

---

### Overview
The **Dynamic Energy Optimizer** helps households and offices **reduce energy usage and electricity costs** without relying on IoT devices. By using **user-input data** such as appliance usage patterns, electricity bills, and local weather forecasts, the system can:

- Predict **peak energy hours**  
- Suggest **cost-saving schedules**  
- Visualize energy trends through interactive dashboards  

This AI-driven approach empowers users to **save money, optimize energy consumption, and reduce their carbon footprint**â€”all through software-based insights.

### Key Features

- **Home Dashboard**  
  Quick summary of total energy usage and high-consumption appliances.

- **Data Input**  
  Simple forms to add appliances, usage schedules, and past electricity bills.

- **AI Insights**  
  Predicts peak energy hours and highlights them with color-coded cues.

- **Cost-Saving Suggestions**  
  Recommends optimized schedules for running appliances during off-peak times.

- **Bill & Savings Comparison**  
  Interactive charts comparing current predictions with historical bills to track potential savings.

- **Notifications & Reminders**  
  Pop-up alerts for peak hours or recommended appliance schedules.

- **Visualization**  
  Graphs and charts for trends, predictions, and comparisons.
