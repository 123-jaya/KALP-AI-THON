Project: The Dynamic Energy Optimizer
Overview

The Dynamic Energy Optimizer helps households and offices reduce energy usage and electricity costs without relying on IoT devices. By using user-input data—like appliance usage patterns, electricity bills, and local weather forecasts—the system predicts peak energy hours, suggests cost-saving schedules, and visualizes energy trends through interactive dashboards.

This AI-driven approach empowers users to save money, optimize energy consumption, and reduce their carbon footprint—all through software-based insights.

Key Features
